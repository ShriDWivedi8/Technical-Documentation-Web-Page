                    <h3>What is Java</h3>
                </header>

                <p>
                    Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few
                    implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers write once,
                    and run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java
                    without the need for recompilation. Java was first released in 1995 and is widely used for
                    developing applications for desktop, web, and mobile devices.
                    Java is known for its simplicity, robustness, and security features, making it a popular choice for
                    enterprise-level applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1997, Sun Microsystems approached the ISO standards body and later formalized Java, but it soon
                    withdrew from the process. At one time, Sun made most of its Java implementations available without
                    charge, despite their proprietary software status. Sun generated revenue from Java through the
                    selling of licenses for specialized products such as the Java Enterprise System.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Implementation of a Java application program involves a following step. They include:
                <ol>
                    <li type="1">Creating the program</li>
                    <li>Compiling the program</li>
                    <li>Running the program</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                Remember that, before we begin creating the program, the Java Development Kit (JDK) must be properly
                installed on our system and also path will be <br>
                • Creating Program <br>
                We can create a program using Text Editor (Notepad) or IDE (NetBeans) <br>
                <pre>
                    class Test
                    { 
                    public static void main(String []args) 
                    { 
                    System.out.println(“My First Java Program.”); 
                    } 
                    }; 
                </pre>

                </p>

                <h2>Java Terminology</h2>
                Before learning Java, one must be familiar with these common terms of Java.
                <ol>
                    <li type="1"> Java Virtual Machine(JVM): This is generally referred to as JVM.</li>
                    <li>There are three execution phases
                        of a program.</li>
                    <li> They are written, compile and run the program.
                    </li>

                </ol>

                Writing a program is done by a java programmer like you and me.
                The compilation is done by the JAVAC compiler which is a primary Java compiler included in the Java
                development kit (JDK). It takes the Java program as input and generates bytecode as output.
                In the Running phase of a program, JVM executes the bytecode generated by the compiler.
                Now, we understood that the function of Java Virtual Machine is to execute the bytecode produced by
                the compiler. Every Operating System has a different JVM but the output they produce after the
                execution of bytecode is the same across all the operating systems. This is why Java is known as a
                platform-independent language.

                </p>
                <p>
                <h2>Object-Oriented Programming Language:</h2> Organizing the program in the terms of a collection of
                objects
                is a way of object-oriented programming, each of which represents an instance of the class. <br><br>

                The four main concepts of Object-Oriented programming are:
                <ul>
                    <li type="disk"> Abstraction</li>
                    <li>Encapsulation</li>
                    <li>Inheritance</li>
                    <li> Polymorphism</li>
                </ul>

                    <h3>Objects and Classes</h3>
                </header>
                <p>As the name suggests, Object-Oriented Programming or OOPs refers to languages that use objects in
                    programming, they use objects as a primary source to implement what is to happen in the code.
                    Objects are seen by the viewer or user, performing tasks assigned by you. Object-oriented
                    programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism etc. in
                    programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them
                    so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function. </p>
                <p>
                    An Object can be defined as an instance of a class. An object contains an address and takes up some
                    space in memory. Objects can communicate without knowing the details of each other's data or code.
                    The only necessary thing is the type of message accepted and the type of response returned by the
                    objects. <br> <br>

                    Example: A dog is an object because it has states like color, name, breed, etc. as well as behaviors
                    like wagging the tail, barking, eating, etc.

                </p>
                <p>
                <h3>Class</h3>
                Collection of objects is called class. It is a logical entity. <br>
                <br>

                A class can also be defined as a blueprint from which you can create an individual object. Class
                doesn't consume any space.

                    public class Main {
                        int x = 5; 
                      
                        public static void main(String[] args) { 
                          Main myObj = new Main(); 
                          System.out.println(myObj.x);
                        } 
                      } 
                    </pre>

                <header>
                    <h3>Encapsulation</h3>
                </header>
                <p> The meaning of Encapsulation, is to make sure that "sensitive" data is hidden from users. To achieve
                    this, you must: <br><br>

                    declare class variables/attributes as private <br><br>
                    provide public get and set methods to access and update the value of a private variable</p>
                <p>
                <h4>Get and Set</h4>
                You have learned that private variables can only be accessed within the same <br>
                class (an outside class has no access to it). However, it is possible to access them if we provide
                public get and set methods. <br> <br> <br>

                The get method returns the variable value, and the set method sets the value. <br> <br>

                Syntax for both is that they start with either get or set, followed by the name of the variable, <br>
                with the first letter in upper case: <br>
                </p>

                <pre>
                    public class Person {
                        private String name; // private = restricted access
                      
                        // Getter
                        public String getName() {
                          return name;
                        }
                      
                        // Setter
                        public void setName(String newName) {
                          this.name = newName;
                        }
                      }
                </pre>
                <p>
                <h5>Example explained </h5>
                The get method returns the value of the variable name. <br>

                The set method takes a parameter (newName) and assigns it to the name variable. The this keyword is <br>
                used to refer to the current object. <br>

                However, as the name variable is declared as private, we cannot access it from outside this class: <br>
                </p>
                <pre>
                    public class Main {
                        public static void main(String[] args) {
                          Person myObj = new Person();
                          myObj.name = "John";  // error
                          System.out.println(myObj.name); // error 
                        }
                      }
                </pre>

            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="polymorphism">
                <header>
                    <h3>polymorphism</h3>
                </header>
                <p>
                    Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each
                    other by inheritance. <br>

                    Like we specified in the previous chapter; Inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from  
                    another class. Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks. This allows us to perform 
                    a single action in different ways. <br>

                    For example, think of a superclass called Animal that has a method called animalSound(). Subclasses 
                    of Animals could be Pigs, Cats, Dogs, Birds - And they also have their own implementation of an 
                    animal sound (the pig oinks, and the cat meows, etc.): <br>
                </p>
                <pre>
                    class Animal {
                        public void animalSound() {
                          System.out.println("The animal makes a sound");
                        }
                      }
                      
                      class Pig extends Animal {
                        public void animalSound() {
                          System.out.println("The pig says: wee wee");
                        }
                      }
                      
                      class Dog extends Animal {
                        public void animalSound() {
                          System.out.println("The dog says: bow wow");
                        }
                      }
                </pre>
           <p>we use the extends keyword to inherit from a class. <br>

            Now we can create Pig and Dog objects and call the animalSound() method on both of them:</p>
                <pre>
                    class Animal {
                        public void animalSound() {
                          System.out.println("The animal makes a sound");
                        }
                      }
                      
                      class Pig extends Animal {
                        public void animalSound() {
                          System.out.println("The pig says: wee wee");
                        }
                      }
                      
                      class Dog extends Animal {
                        public void animalSound() {
                          System.out.println("The dog says: bow wow");
                        }
                      }
                      
                      class Main {
                        public static void main(String[] args) {
                          Animal myAnimal = new Animal();  // Create a Animal object
                          Animal myPig = new Pig();  // Create a Pig object
                          Animal myDog = new Dog();  // Create a Dog object
                          myAnimal.animalSound();
                          myPig.animalSound();
                          myDog.animalSound();
                        }
                      }
